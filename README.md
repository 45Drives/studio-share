# studio-share
Client app for Windows, Mac & Linux (RHEL/Debian currently) giving 45Drives hardware users the ability to share files from their servers over a network (internal or external) with collaborators. Perfect for video production workflows or any other collaborative efforts. 

Currently in Beta Testing phase, major features all implemented and working with some small caveats for now regarding External Link Access (sharing files via links over the public web). For this external link sharing to work, your router/modem must have port forwarding for HTTPS (443) set up to your server. We have included instructions in the app for how to do this (for most routers), as well as an experimental method for enabling 443 port via Universal Plug N Play (UPNP) if your router supports it.
