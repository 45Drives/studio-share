# studio-share
Client app for Windows, Mac & Linux (RHEL/Debian currently) giving 45Drives hardware users the ability to share files from their servers over a network (internal or external) with collaborators. Perfect for video production workflows or any other collaborative efforts. 

Currently in Beta Testing phase, major features all implemented and working.
**regarding External Link Access (sharing files via links over the public web):
  For this external link sharing to work, your router/modem must have port forwarding for HTTPS (443 or other configured non-default port) set up to your server. 
  We have included instructions in the app for how to do this (for most routers).
